### What is AWS? ‚òÅÔ∏è

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is a comprehensive suite of cloud services provided by **Amazon**. It allows businesses and developers to access computing power, storage, databases, networking, machine learning, and more, on-demand via the internet. Instead of investing in physical hardware and maintaining infrastructure, AWS lets you "rent" resources and scale as needed. AWS is the backbone for many of the world's leading companies and tech startups, providing the cloud infrastructure that powers everything from web hosting to mobile applications, machine learning, and even video streaming.

AWS offers a broad array of services, including:
- **Compute Power**: Like EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) to run virtual servers.
- **Storage**: Such as S3 (Simple Storage Service) to store data.
- **Databases**: Services like RDS (Relational Database Service) and DynamoDB for NoSQL databases.
- **Networking**: VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) for creating isolated network environments.
- **AI & ML**: Tools like SageMaker for developing machine learning models.
- **Developer Tools**: CloudFormation, CodePipeline, etc. for DevOps automation.
- **Security**: IAM (Identity and Access Management) for managing access controls.
