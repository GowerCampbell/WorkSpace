# Web Scraping LinkedIn Posts

This project automates the process of scraping LinkedIn posts and saving them into a markdown file. The script is designed to run automatically using GitHub Actions, which fetches the posts from a specified source and stores them in a structured markdown format.

## Features

- Scrapes LinkedIn posts (or any other specified website) and saves them into a markdown file (`LinkedIn-Posts.md`).
- The script can be run automatically when pushing code to the repository or on a schedule (e.g., once a day).
- The project utilizes Python, BeautifulSoup, and GitHub Actions for automation.

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally or on GitHub Actions, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, and other dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`).
- GitHub repository with an active workflow setup for automated scraping (GitHub Actions).

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you'd like to run the scraper locally or modify the code, start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraping.git
cd web-scraping
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment for Python projects:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Once your virtual environment is active, install the necessary dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Running the Script Locally

You can run the scraping script directly from your terminal:

```bash
python scrape_posts.py
```

### 2. Running the Script on GitHub

If you've set up GitHub Actions (as outlined in the repository), the scraper will automatically run whenever:

- You push code to the `main` branch.
- The schedule trigger (e.g., daily) activates.

You can check the results in the `LinkedIn-Posts.md` file.

### 3. Scheduling the Scraper (GitHub Actions)

The scraper is configured to run automatically every day at midnight (UTC). This is controlled by the cron expression in the GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/scrape.yml`).

You can adjust the schedule to your preferred time or manually trigger the workflow from the GitHub Actions tab.

## Output

After running the scraper, you will find the LinkedIn posts saved in a markdown file called `LinkedIn-Posts.md` in your repository. Each post will be formatted with a title, date, and content.

Example format:
```markdown
## 2025

### Post 1 - February 05, 2025
> *This is my first LinkedIn post!*

### Post 2 - January 30, 2025
> *Exploring AI and its applications.*

## 2024

### Post 3 - December 15, 2024
> *Exploring new career opportunities.*
```
